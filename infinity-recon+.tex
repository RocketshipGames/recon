\reconplus is a set of unofficial firefight missions for Corvus
Belli's \emph{Infinity} miniatures game.  Armies are small, the action
fast, games quick, and atypical tactics and strategies required.

Though it works as a stepping stone, \reconplus is not primarily
designed to be an introductory or teaching mode.  It's simply a
different way to play.  All the \emph{Infinity} rules apply and the
missions are strategically deep, but the small armies and play areas
combined with a few gameplay tweaks emphasize different units,
weapons, and tactics.  A line trooper with a combi-rifle should never
be discounted in \emph{Infinity}, but \reconplus is their time to
shine.

%\emph{Get in there, soldier!}

Changes to \reconplus for the \emph{N5} edition of \emph{Infinity}
include:
\begin{squishitemize}
\item Squad construction limitations have been removed as order
  generation and other aspects are now much better balanced across
  troop types than in earlier editions.

\item The restriction to a single fireteam has been removed as the
  benefits of fireteams are not as strong as previous and they are now
  available to the core factions.

\item Troopers no longer need to be Specialist Troops to activate
  objectives, but specialists provide enhanced reliability, making
  squads less fragile in button-pushing missions.

  % and enables using a single list across more mission classes.

%\item Alternate match list selection formats are suggested for
%  organized play.
\end{squishitemize}

\fancyfoot[L]{\footnotesize\usefont{T1}{razor}{m}{n}[~Squad Construction~]}

\section{Squad Construction}

\reconplus army lists are chosen according to the following rules:

\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Army lists may include at most~150 army points and~3 SWC.

\item The entire army list must be organized within a single combat
  group.

%\item Troopers with classification Character are not permitted.
%
%\item Only one trooper with the Impetuous, Tactical Awareness, or
%  Strategos skills may be included per every~4 troopers.  The Frenzy
%  skill is not limited.
%
%\item Only one trooper with multiple wounds, structure, or profiles
%  (e.g., Symbiont Armor), or the No Wound Incapacitation skill, may be
%  included per every~4 troopers.

\end{itemize}

All other army list selection rules from the core rules apply, e.g.,
requiring a Lieutenant.

%\begin{recon}
%Note that, as elaborated in the gameplay rules, in \reconplus a player
%may only have a single fireteam of any type active at any time, with a
%maximum of~3 members.
%\end{recon}

\subsection{Army List Selection}

Most \emph{Infinity} organized play has players bring two army lists
from which they choose one each round after their mission, opponent,
and play area (table) are determined.  For both casual and organized
\reconplus play, it's worth considering two other options:
\begin{squishitemize}
  \item \emph{Tailored:} Army lists are composed after establishing
    mission, opponent, and play area. In a tournament, players would
    be given time to construct lists at the start of each match,
    utilizing the same faction throughout but otherwise not
    necessarily related.

  \item \emph{Generalist:} Army lists are composed before knowing any
    match details and are used across multiple missions. In a
    tournament, players would bring a single army list that they have
    to make work in each game.  Missions might not even be determined
    until the start of the event or rounds.  This permits a very fast
    paced event schedule and encourages all-purposes lists and units
    able to achieve varied mission objectives.

\end{squishitemize}

%\subsection{Extras}
%
%Players or event organizers may optionally permit either or both of
%the following extras:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{Spec-Ops:} Army lists may include a single Spec-Ops trooper of up to~12~XP.
%
%\item \emph{Soldiers of Fortune:} Army lists may include up to~38 army
%  points of Mercenary Troops, respecting their AVA, or a single
%  Mercenary Troop selection of any army point value (e.g., a single
%  mercenary TAG may be included by itself despite the~38pt limit).
%\end{itemize}
%
%All other standard \emph{Infinity N4} rules, addendums, and FAQs apply.


\fancyfoot[L]{\footnotesize\usefont{T1}{razor}{m}{n}[~Rules~]}
\section{Play Area}

\reconplus games take place in a play area~22--28in wide and~30--36in
long.  In typical missions with deployment zones along the opposed
short edges, the depth of the deployment zones should be calculated
such that they are 24in apart, i.e.:

\bigskip
\centerline{%
\begin{tabular}{C{1in}C{2in}}
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue}\textcolor{White}{\textbf{Play Area Length}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{Deployment Zone Depth}} \\
  30in & 3in\\
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue!10} 32in & 4in\\
  34in & 5in\\
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue!10} 36in & 6in
\end{tabular}
}

%Be sure to place terrain to minimize long firelanes.  At least one
%piece of terrain should touch each play area edge to prevent open
%spaces running its full length.  The tallest terrain should be toward
%the middle of the play area, to prevent creating a ``sniper bowl.''

\begin{recon}
  The mats in Corvus Belli's recent \emph{Infinity} starter terrain
  sets are 24in by 34in.  Some older \emph{Infinity} starter sets had
  mats 32in long.  Mats and boards for Games Workshop's widely played
  \emph{Kill Team} are 22in by 30in.  Organizers should not
  necessarily feel that all tables within an event need to use exactly
  the same play area dimensions.
\end{recon}


\section{Gameplay}

The following rules apply in all \reconplus games unless excepted by a
mission or event.

%\subsection{Pregame}
%
%Match preparation proceeds as follows.
%
%\missionrule{Startup Sequence.}  The following sequence is used in
%setting up each match---
%
%\begin{squishitemize}
%\item Establish mission, opponents \& factions, and play area.
%
%%\item Select classified objectives (see below).
%
%\item Determine army lists as permitted (by selection or composition).
%
%\item Initiative Roll.
%
%\item Deployment Phase.
%
%\item Simultaneously reveal chosen army lists (the public information).
%\end{squishitemize}
%

%\missionrule{Classified Objectives.}  Before choosing their army list,
%each player draws~2 classified objective cards and secretly chooses~1
%to keep in play for themselves (do not reveal either).  Achieving
%classified objectives, including the Secure HVT option (see below), is
%worth~2 objective points in each \reconplus mission.  They may only be
%scored once.

%\missionrule{High Value Targets.}  Each player must deploy a High
%Value Target~(HVT) model at the beginning of their deployment.  These
%must be placed at least~4'' outside of both deployment zones, directly
%on the play area itself (not on any terrain).  A player may opt at any
%point to replace their chosen classified objective with the Secure HVT
%classified objective:

%\begin{squishitemize}
%\item \textbf{Secure HVT} is accomplished if at game end you have a
%  trooper not in a Null state inside the zone of control of the enemy
%  HVT model, and at the same time there are no enemy troopers not in a
%  Null state within the zone of control of your own HVT model.
%\end{squishitemize}

\subsection{Strategic Use of Command Tokens}

The Command Token: Strategic Use options are unaltered caveat the
following.

\missionrule{Order Denial.} The second player may make Strategic Use
of a Command Token to remove a single Regular Order from their
opponent's order pool in the latter's first player turn if their
opponent generated ten orders or less (including Regular, Irregular,
and Tactical Orders).  If more than ten orders were generated they may
remove two Regular Orders.

\missionrule{Logistical.} Whether Speedball Tokens may be used should
be decided before list selection.


\subsection{In-Game}

The following in-game rules apply to all \reconplus matches.

%\missionrule{Limited Fireteams.}  A player may only have a single
%fireteam active at any point in time, across all types.  That fireteam
%may be comprised of a maximum of~3 members.  Forming a fireteam
%automatically and immediately dissolves a player's existing fireteam.

\missionrule{Exclusion Zone.}  Troopers may not be deployed into
Exclusion Zones, as specified by some missions, by any means in either
deployment or gameplay.  This includes Combat Jump, Infiltration, and
all other skills.  Deployable Weapons are not subject to this
constraint.

\missionrule{Specialist Troops.}  Hackers, Doctors, Engineers, Forward
Observers, Paramedics, and troopers with Chain of Command or
Specialist Operative are considered Specialist Troops.  Peripheral
(Servant) models cannot perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

\missionrule{Connect Mission Objective.} Some missions make the
following short skill available.
\label{sec:hack-objective}

\medskip\centerline{\setlength\fboxrule{2pt}
\cfbox{LimeGreen}{\begin{minipage}{6.5in}
  \colorbox{LimeGreen}{\parbox{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}{\textcolor{White}{\textbf{\large Connect Mission Objective} \hfill Short Skill}}}\\
  \colorbox{SkyBlue}{\parbox{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}{\textcolor{White}{Attack}}}

  \medskip
  \textsc{Requirements}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item The user must be a model (not a marker) in base contact with a
    mission objective marker or terrain piece.
  \end{squishitemize}

  \medskip
  \colorbox{Gray!24}{\begin{minipage}{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}

  \medskip
      \textsc{Effects}
      \begin{squishitemize}
      \item The user makes a Normal WIP roll to attempt connecting to
        the mission objective marker or terrain piece with which it is
        in base contact.  Specialist Troops roll~+1B and one die of
        their player's choice is discarded.

      \item If successful, the user's player is connected to the
        mission objective; mark it appropriately.  The other player is
        no longer connected to this mission objective if they
        previously were; remove any such marking.
      \end{squishitemize}
    \end{minipage}}
\end{minipage}}}


\subsection{Endgame}

The following outline endgame and scoring conditions for \reconplus
missions.

\missionrule{Game End.}  All matches conclude at the end of the third
game round.  Unless noted otherwise by a mission or event,
\emph{Retreat!} rules do not apply.  If one player is eliminated the
surviving player may play out their remaining turns attempting to
score objectives.

\begin{recon}
  For beginner and casual events a 90 minute round time limit is
  recommended. Experienced players can typically complete RECON+ games
  in about 60 minutes.
\end{recon}

\missionrule{Scoring.}  All standard \reconplus missions are scored out of a
possible~7 objective points.  Players do NOT automatically receive
maximum points for eliminating their opponent.

%\begin{recon}
%  If your opponent cripples your ability to achieve the mission
%  objectives before you eliminate them, then you have not actually
%  earned a full victory!
%\end{recon}

\missionrule{Destroyed.} Troopers are considered destroyed when they
enter the Dead state, are in a Null state at the end of the game, or
have not been deployed by the end of the game.

%Those troopers not
%destroyed are considered to have survived, as are troopers in
%\emph{Retreat!} which exit the play area through the long edge of
%their player's deployment zone.

\missionrule{Domination.}  A player dominates a Sector, as determined
in some missions, if they have more victory points within the Sector
than their opponent.  Only troopers represented by a model or marker,
including Proxies and Peripherals, are counted.  Note that this
excludes troopers in Hidden Deployment.  Troopers are considered to be
solely within the single Sector, if any, containing more than half
their base or marker.  Troopers in a Null state are not counted unless
the state specifically notes otherwise.  For purposes of Domination,
troopers in Shasvastii-Embryo state are counted both during the game
and at game end.

%\clearpage
\section{Mission Elements}

Most \reconplus missions revolve around interacting with elements of
the \emph{Infinity} world as defined in each scenario.  These elements
may be represented by a physical terrain piece or a marker as is
convenient.  If a marker is used they are considered to have the
silhouettes given below and provide cover or block line-of-fire (LOF)
accordingly.

% except Civilians, which do neither.

%\begin{recon}
%  This is a slight variance from the main \emph{Infinity} rulebook, in
%  which mission elements such as objectives only grant cover when
%  physically represented by 3D terrain pieces.
%\end{recon}

Mission elements cannot be directly targeted by attacks or skills
other than those provided by missions.  They are otherwise effectively
terrain, unaffected by indirect attacks, e.g., an Impact Template, and
only affecting attacks as terrain would, such as by providing cover.

\bigskip
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue}\textcolor{White}{\textbf{Element}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{Type}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{ARM}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{BTS}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{W/STR}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{Silhouette}} \\
  Antenna & Scenery Item & 4 & 3 & 2 & S6~ (40mm base x 55mm high)\\
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue!10} Console & Scenery Item & 0 & 0 & 1 & S5~ (40mm base x 45mm high)\\
%  Civilian & Neutral Model & 0 & 0 & 1 & S1- (20mm base x 25mm high)\\

  Tech-Coffin & Scenery Item & 1 & 0 & 1 & S5~ (40mm base x 45mm high)\\
\end{tabular}
}

%\begin{recon}
%  Civilians have a 20mm base here to denote them as diminutive,
%  cowering, and not cover (by \emph{Human Sphere} they do not block
%  LOF).  Feel free to use 25mm bases/markers.
