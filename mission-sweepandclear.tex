\label{mission:sweepandclear}

\subsection{Play Area Configuration}

Place~2 Consoles, each 12'' from the play area long edges and 6'' from
the center toward the deployment zones.  No model or marker may be
deployed in base contact with a Console.

\subsection{Mission Rules}

The Hack Mission Objective short skill is available in this scenario.

\subsection{End Game}

There are no special end game conditions for this mission.

\subsection{Scoring}

% The following rules determine the outcome of this mission---

\missionrule{Sectors.}  After each game turn measure four
Sectors on the play area dividing the space between the deployment
zones into equal quarters and determine domination of each.

\missionrule{Tapped Sensor Grid.}  For each Console they control and
have a model in base contact, players may designate a Sector after
each game turn in which they are considered to have an additional~20
army points for purposes of domination.  Both players make this
declaration simultaneously.  A Sector may be designated twice by a
player if they control both Consoles.
