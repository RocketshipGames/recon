\label{mission:sweepandclear}

\subsection{Play Area Configuration}

Place~2 Consoles, each 12'' from the play area long edges and 6'' from
the center toward the deployment zones.  No model or marker may be
deployed in base contact with a Console.

\subsection{Mission Rules}

The Hack Mission Objective short skill is available in this scenario
(see page~\pageref{sec:hack-objective}).

\subsection{End Game}

There are no special end game conditions for this mission.

\subsection{Scoring}

% The following rules determine the outcome of this mission---

\missionrule{Sectors.}  After each game turn measure four
Sectors on the play area dividing the space between the deployment
zones into equal quarters and determine domination of each.

\missionrule{Tapped Sensor Grid.}  After each game turn, for each
Console they have connected and a model in base contact, players may
designate a Sector in which they are considered to have an
additional~20 army points for purposes of domination.  Both players
make this declaration simultaneously.  A Sector may be designated
twice by a player if they control both Consoles.  Note that a
Specialist is required to connect a Console per the Hack Mission
Objective skill, but any model may be in base contact to enable this
ability.
