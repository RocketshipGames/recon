\reconplus is a set of unofficial firefight missions for Corvus
Belli's \emph{Infinity} miniatures game.  With matches at~150 points,
the action is fast; games are quick; preferred units, weapons, and
tactics are different; and hard choices have to be made in designing
army lists.

%Despite the rulebook and starter box missions, Though the starter
%sets include stripped down missions for learning and teaching
%\emph{Infinity}, and \emph{CodeOne} also aims to facilitate smaller
%games,

These missions remain relevant in the \emph{N4} era for several
reasons:
\begin{squishitemize}
\item Quick games with simpler missions are a nice change of pace.

\item Adapting to very different army constraints and play areas is an
  interesting challenge.

\item Players might be comfortable with the rules but not have models
  for a full size game.

\item Only a small selection of factions and units are included in
  \emph{CodeOne}.

\item Not all players want to learn \emph{CodeOne's} unit and rules
  variations from \emph{N4}.

\item Official ITS missions don't generally scale down well to~150pts.
\end{squishitemize}

It may work as a stepping stone, but \reconplus is not designed to be
introductory or teaching oriented.  It's simply a different way to
play.  All the \emph{Infinity} rules apply and the missions are
strategically deep, but the atypical army constraints, gameplay rules,
and small play areas emphasize different units, weapons, and tactics.
A line trooper with a combi-rifle should never be discounted in
\emph{Infinity}.  But \reconplus is their time to shine.  \emph{Get in
there, soldier!}

\fancyfoot[L]{\footnotesize\usefont{T1}{razor}{m}{n}[~Squad Construction~]}

\section{Squad Construction}

Players simultaneously determine their army lists for a match after
establishing their mission, opponent, and play area.  In casual play
this might mean constructing the entire list.  For a tournament
players may construct two army lists before the event, chosen from the
same faction (including sectorial), and select which to use at this
point in each match.

\reconplus army lists are chosen according to the following rules:

\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Army lists may include at most~150 army points and~3 SWC.

\item Troopers with classification Character that cost more than~35pts
  are not permitted.

\item Only one trooper with the Impetuous, Tactical Awareness, or
  Strategos skills may be included per every~4 troopers.  The Frenzy
  skill is not limited.

\item Only one trooper with multiple wounds, structure, or profiles
  (e.g., Symbiont Armor), or the No Wound Incapacitation skill, may be
  included per every~4 troopers.

\item The entire army list must be organized within a single combat
  group.
\end{itemize}

\begin{recon}
Note that, as elaborated in the gameplay rules, in \reconplus a player
may only have a single fireteam of any type active at any time, with a
maximum of~3 members.
\end{recon}

\subsection{Extras}

Players or event organizers may optionally permit either or both of
the following extras:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Spec-Ops:} Army lists may include a single Spec-Ops trooper of up to~12~XP.

\item \emph{Soldiers of Fortune:} Army lists may include up to~38 army
  points of Mercenary Troops, respecting their AVA, or a single
  Mercenary Troop selection of any army point value (e.g., a single
  mercenary TAG may be included by itself despite the~38pt limit).
\end{itemize}

All other standard \emph{Infinity N4} rules, addendums, and FAQs apply.


\clearpage
\fancyfoot[L]{\footnotesize\usefont{T1}{razor}{m}{n}[~Rules~]}
\section{Play Area}

\reconplus games take place in a play area~24'' wide and 32'' long.
Unless noted otherwise in a mission, deployment zones are 4'' from the
short ends of the play area.

Be sure to place terrain to minimize long firelanes.  At least one
piece of terrain should touch each play area edge to prevent open
spaces running its full length.  The tallest terrain should be toward
the middle of the play area, to prevent creating a ``sniper bowl.''

\begin{recon}
  Varying the length or width of the play area a few inches in either
  direction to suit practical considerations, e.g., terrain mat size,
  is not a problem.  Incorporate any additional length evenly into the
  deployment zones, so the zones are always 24'' apart.
\end{recon}


\section{Gameplay}

The following rules apply in all \reconplus games unless excepted by a
mission or event.

\subsection{Pregame}

Match preparation proceeds as follows.

\missionrule{Startup Sequence.}  The following sequence is used in
setting up each match---

\begin{squishitemize}
\item Establish mission, opponents \& factions, and play area.

%\item Select classified objectives (see below).

\item Simultaneously reveal chosen army lists (the public information).

\item Initiative Roll.

\item Deployment Phase.
\end{squishitemize}

\missionrule{Order Denial.} The second player may make Strategic Use
of a Command Token to remove only a single Regular Order from their
opponent's order pool in the latter's first player turn, not two.  The
other Command Token: Strategic Use options are unaltered.

%\missionrule{Classified Objectives.}  Before choosing their army list,
%each player draws~2 classified objective cards and secretly chooses~1
%to keep in play for themselves (do not reveal either).  Achieving
%classified objectives, including the Secure HVT option (see below), is
%worth~2 objective points in each \reconplus mission.  They may only be
%scored once.

%\missionrule{High Value Targets.}  Each player must deploy a High
%Value Target~(HVT) model at the beginning of their deployment.  These
%must be placed at least~4'' outside of both deployment zones, directly
%on the play area itself (not on any terrain).  A player may opt at any
%point to replace their chosen classified objective with the Secure HVT
%classified objective:

%\begin{squishitemize}
%\item \textbf{Secure HVT} is accomplished if at game end you have a
%  trooper not in a Null state inside the zone of control of the enemy
%  HVT model, and at the same time there are no enemy troopers not in a
%  Null state within the zone of control of your own HVT model.
%\end{squishitemize}


\subsection{In-Game}

The following in-game rules apply to all \reconplus matches.

%\reconplus
%\missionrule{Command Tokens: Strategic Use.} Command Tokens may not be
%used to nullify Orders.

\missionrule{Limited Fireteams.}  A player may only have a single
fireteam active at any point in time, across all types.  That fireteam
may be comprised of a maximum of~3 members.  Forming a fireteam
automatically and immediately dissolves a player's existing fireteam.

\pagebreak
\missionrule{Exclusion Zone.}  Some missions include an Exclusion Zone
in the play area configuration.  Troopers may not be deployed into
this area by any means, either in the deployment phase or in gameplay.
This prohibition includes Airborne Deployment, Forward Deployment,
Infiltration, and all other skills.  Deployable Weapons are not
subject to this constraint.

\missionrule{Specialists Troops.}  Hackers, Doctors, Engineers,
Forward Observers, Paramedics, and troopers possessing the Chain of
Command or Specialist Operative special skills are considered
Specialist Troops in all missions.  Repeaters and Peripheral (Servant)
models cannot be used to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

\missionrule{Connect Mission Objective.} Some missions make the
following short skill available.
\label{sec:hack-objective}

\medskip\centerline{\setlength\fboxrule{2pt}
\cfbox{LimeGreen}{\begin{minipage}{6.5in}
  \colorbox{LimeGreen}{\parbox{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}{\textcolor{White}{\textbf{\large Connect Mission Objective} \hfill Short Skill}}}\\

  \medskip
  \textsc{Requirements}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item The user must be a Specialist Troop model (not a marker) in
    base contact with a mission objective marker or terrain piece.
  \end{squishitemize}

  \colorbox{Gray!24}{\begin{minipage}{\linewidth-2\fboxsep}

  \medskip
      \textsc{Effects}
      \begin{squishitemize}
      \item The user makes a Normal WIP roll to attempt connecting to
        the mission objective marker or terrain piece with which it is
        in base contact.

      \item If successful, the user's player is connected to the
        mission objective; mark it appropriately.  The other player is
        no longer connected to this mission objective if they
        previously were; remove any such marking.
      \end{squishitemize}
    \end{minipage}}
\end{minipage}}}


\subsection{Endgame}

The following outline endgame and scoring conditions for \reconplus
missions.

\missionrule{Game End.}  All matches conclude at the end of the third
game round.  Unless noted otherwise by a mission or event,
\emph{Retreat!} rules apply as given in the main \emph{Infinity N4}
rulebook except the game does not end once one player has no models in
play.  The surviving player may play out their remaining turns
attempting to score objectives.

\begin{recon}
  For beginner and casual events a 90 minute round time limit is
  recommended. Experienced players can typically complete RECON+ games
  in 60--75 minutes.
\end{recon}

\missionrule{Destroyed.} Troopers are considered destroyed when they
enter the Dead state, are in a Null state at the end of the game, or
have not been deployed by the end of the game.  Those troopers not
destroyed are considered to have survived, as are troopers in
\emph{Retreat!} which exit the play area through the long edge of
their player's deployment zone.

\missionrule{Domination.}  A player dominates a Sector, as determined
in some missions, if they have more victory points within the Sector
than their opponent.  Only troopers represented by a model or marker,
including Proxies and Peripherals, are counted.  Note that this
excludes troopers in Hidden Deployment.  Troopers are considered to be
solely within the single Sector, if any, containing more than half
their base or marker.  Troopers in a Null state are not counted unless
the state specifically notes otherwise.  For purposes of Domination,
troopers in Shasvastii-Embryo state are counted both during the game
and at game end.

\missionrule{Scoring.}  All \reconplus missions are scored out of a
possible~7 objective points.  Players do NOT automatically receive
maximum points for eliminating their opponent.

\begin{recon}
  If your opponent cripples your ability to achieve the mission
  objectives before you eliminate them, then you have not actually
  earned a full victory!
\end{recon}

%\clearpage
\section{Mission Elements}

Most \reconplus missions revolve around interacting with elements of
the \emph{Infinity} world as defined in each scenario.  These elements
may be represented by a physical terrain piece or a marker as is
convenient.  In either case they are considered to have the
silhouettes given below and provide cover or block LOF accordingly.

% except Civilians, which do neither.

%\begin{recon}
%  This is a slight variance from the main \emph{Infinity} rulebook, in
%  which mission elements such as objectives only grant cover when
%  physically represented by 3D terrain pieces.
%\end{recon}

Mission elements cannot be directly targeted by attacks or skills
other than those provided by missions.  They are otherwise effectively
terrain, unaffected by indirect attacks, e.g., an Impact Template, and
only affecting attacks as terrain would, such as by providing cover.

\bigskip
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
  \rowcolor{CornflowerBlue}\textcolor{White}{\textbf{Element}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{Type}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{ARM}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{BTS}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{W/STR}} & \textcolor{White}{\textbf{Silhouette}} \\

  Tech-Coffin & Scenery Item & 1 & 0 & 1 & S5~ (40mm base x 45mm high)\\
\end{tabular}
}

%\begin{recon}
%  Civilians have a 20mm base here to denote them as diminutive,
%  cowering, and not cover (by \emph{Human Sphere} they do not block
%  LOF).  Feel free to use 25mm bases/markers.
%\end{recon}

%\section{Materials}
%
%As always, for an organized event, players should bring:
%\begin{squishitemize}
%\item Two printed copies of your complete army lists, for yourself and
%  the event organizer(s).

%\item Printed copies of your courtesy army lists to give to your
%  opponent each round.
%
%\item All models, dice, markers, templates, and other materials needed
%  to play.
