\label{mission:sweepandclear}

\subsection{Play Area Configuration}

Place~2 Consoles, each 12'' from the play area long edges and 6'' from
the center toward the deployment zones.  No model or marker may be
deployed in base contact with a Console.

\subsection{Mission Rules}

The Connect Mission Objective short skill may be used on the Consoles
in this scenario (see page~\pageref{sec:hack-objective}).  Engineers
receive a~+3 MOD on the WIP check to connect a Console.

\subsection{End Game}

There are no special end game conditions for this mission.

\subsection{Scoring}

% The following rules determine the outcome of this mission---

\missionrule{Sectors.}  After each game round measure four
Sectors on the play area dividing the space between the deployment
zones into equal quarters and determine Domination of each.

\missionrule{Search Teams.} Forward Observers not in a Null state
provide an additional~4 victory points toward Domination in this
mission.  Troopers with the Sensor special skill and not in a Null
state provide an additional~8 victory points toward Domination in this
mission. These bonuses apply cumulatively for troopers that possess
both skills.

\missionrule{Tapped Sensor Grid.}  After each game round, for each
Console they have currently connected and a model (not a marker) in
base contact, players may designate a Sector in which they are
considered to have an additional~20 army points for purposes of
Domination.  Both players make this declaration simultaneously.  A
single Sector may be designated twice by a player if they are able to
use both Consoles.
